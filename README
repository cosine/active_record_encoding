# ActiveRecordEncoding â€” Module to make ActiveRecord aware of Unicode
# encoding issues.
#
# ActiveRecordEncoding keeps two variables on the default encoding to
# use when accessing the database.
#
#   ActiveRecordEncoding.external_encoding = 'ISO-8859-1'
#   ActiveRecordEncoding.internal_encoding = 'UTF-8'
#
# If the external_encoding is not explicitly set then no conversions
# will be done.  The internal_encoding value defaults to
# Encoding.default_internal if not explicitly set.
#
# The internal_encoding value is the encoding of the Strings that are
# returned by ActiveRecord from String-based columns.  The
# external_encoding value tells ActiveRecord how the database is
# encoding the data.  A conversion is done if necessary.
#
# When data is being saved back to the database, the internal_encoding
# value is ignored and the encoding of the input is used to determine
# how to encode the data in the external_encoding.
#
# Encodings may also be defined on a table-by-table basis in the model
# definition.  A future version of ActiveRecordEncoding may support
# setting the encoding on a column-by-column basis, but that is not
# currently possible.
